description: The following analytic detects `PutBucketLifecycle` events in AWS CloudTrail logs where a user sets a lifecycle rule for an S3 bucket with an expiration period of fewer than three days. This detection leverages CloudTrail logs to identify suspicious lifecycle configurations. This activity is significant because attackers may use it to delete CloudTrail logs quickly, thereby evading detection and impairing forensic investigations. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to cover their tracks, making it difficult to trace their actions and respond to the breach effectively.
data_source:
- AWS CloudTrail PutBucketLifecycle
search: '`amazon_security_lake` api.operation=PutBucketLifecycle | spath input=api.request.data path=LifecycleConfiguration.Rule.NoncurrentVersionExpiration.NoncurrentDays output=NoncurrentDays | where NoncurrentDays < 3 | spath input=api.request.data | fillnull | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by api.operation actor.user.uid actor.user.account.uid http_request.user_agent src_endpoint.ip cloud.region NoncurrentDays bucketName | rename actor.user.uid as user, src_endpoint.ip as src_ip, cloud.region as region, http_request.user_agent as user_agent | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` |  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `asl_aws_defense_evasion_putbucketlifecycle_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install Splunk AWS Add on and enable CloudTrail logs in your AWS Environment. We recommend our users to set the expiration days value according to your company's log retention policies.
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible that it is a legitimate admin activity. Please consider filtering out these noisy events using userAgent, user_arn field names.
