description: The following analytic detects `PutBucketLifecycle` events in AWS CloudTrail
  logs where a user sets a lifecycle rule for an S3 bucket with an expiration period
  of fewer than three days. This detection leverages CloudTrail logs to identify suspicious
  lifecycle configurations. This activity is significant because attackers may use
  it to delete CloudTrail logs quickly, thereby evading detection and impairing forensic
  investigations. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to cover their
  tracks, making it difficult to trace their actions and respond to the breach effectively.
data_source:
- AWS CloudTrail PutBucketLifecycle
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName=PutBucketLifecycle user_type=IAMUser errorCode=success
  |  spath path=requestParameters{}.LifecycleConfiguration{}.Rule{}.Expiration{}.Days
  output=expiration_days |  spath path=requestParameters{}.bucketName output=bucket_name
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime  by src region eventName
  userAgent user_arn aws_account_id expiration_days  bucket_name user_type| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  |  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | where expiration_days < 3 | `aws_defense_evasion_putbucketlifecycle_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install Splunk AWS Add on and enable CloudTrail logs in
  your AWS Environment. We recommend our users to set the expiration days value according
  to your company's log retention policies.
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that it is a legitimate admin activity. Please consider filtering out these noisy
  events using userAgent, user_arn field names.
