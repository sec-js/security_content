description: The following analytic detects the creation of suspicious URL shortcut
  link files, often used by malware like CHAOS ransomware. It leverages the Endpoint.Filesystem
  datamodel to identify .url files created outside standard directories, such as Program
  Files. This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt to execute malicious
  code upon system reboot. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to
  achieve persistence and execute harmful payloads, potentially leading to further
  system compromise and data loss.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 11
search: '|tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem where NOT(Filesystem.file_path IN
  ("*\\Program Files*")) Filesystem.file_name = *.url by Filesystem.file_create_time
  Filesystem.process_id  Filesystem.file_name Filesystem.user Filesystem.file_path
  Filesystem.process_guid Filesystem.dest | `drop_dm_object_name(Filesystem)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_user_execution_malicious_url_shortcut_file_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the Filesystem responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Filesystem` node.
known_false_positives: Administrators may allow creation of script or exe in this
  path.
