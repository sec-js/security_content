name: Suspicious SQLite3 LSQuarantine Behavior

description: The following analytic identifies the use of SQLite3 querying the MacOS
  preferences to determine the original URL from which a package was downloaded. This
  detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing
  on process names and command-line executions involving LSQuarantine. This activity
  is significant as it is commonly associated with MacOS adware and other malicious
  software. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could indicate an attempt to track
  or manipulate downloaded packages, potentially leading to further system compromise
  or persistent adware infections.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
