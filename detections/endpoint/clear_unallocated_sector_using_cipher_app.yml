description: this search is to detect execution of cipher.exe to clear the unallocated
  sectors of a specific disk. This technique was seen in some ransomwareto make it
  impossible to forensically recover deleted files.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name = "cipher.exe"
  Processes.process = "*/w:*" by Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.process_id
  Processes.process_guid | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `clear_unallocated_sector_using_cipher_app_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: administrator may execute this app to manage disk
