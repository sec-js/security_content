description: this search is to detect suspicious powershell that processing compressed
  stream data. This technique was seen in obfuscated powershell or powershell with

  execution.
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 Message = "*IO.Compression.*" OR Message = "*IO.StreamReader*"
  OR Message = "*]::Decompress*" | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime by EventCode Message ComputerName User | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `powershell_processing_stream_of_data_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the powershell logs  from your endpoints. make sure you enable needed
  registry to monitor this event.
known_false_positives: powershell may used this function to process compressed data.
