name: Executables Or Script Creation In Suspicious Path

type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic identifies the creation of executables or scripts
  in suspicious file paths on Windows systems. It leverages the Endpoint.Filesystem
  data model to detect files with specific extensions (e.g., .exe, .dll, .ps1) created
  in uncommon directories (e.g., \windows\fonts\, \users\public\). This activity is
  significant as adversaries often use these paths to evade detection and maintain
  persistence. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to execute
  unauthorized code, escalate privileges, or persist within the environment, posing
  a significant security threat.
data_source:
- Sysmon EventID 11
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Filesystem.file_path) as
  file_path count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Filesystem
  where Filesystem.file_name IN ("*.exe", "*.dll", "*.sys", "*.com", "*.vbs", "*.vbe",
  "*.js", "*.ps1", "*.bat", "*.cmd", "*.pif") AND Filesystem.file_path IN ("*\\windows\\fonts\\*",
  "*\\windows\\temp\\*", "*\\users\\public\\*", "*\\windows\\debug\\*", "*\\Users\\Administrator\\Music\\*",
  "*\\Windows\\servicing\\*", "*\\Users\\Default\\*", "*Recycle.bin*", "*\\Windows\\Media\\*",
  "*\\Windows\\repair\\*", "*\\AppData\\Local\\Temp*", "*\\PerfLogs\\*", "*:\\temp\\*")
  by Filesystem.file_create_time Filesystem.process_id Filesystem.file_name Filesystem.user
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Filesystem)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `executables_or_script_creation_in_suspicious_path_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the Filesystem responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Filesystem` node.
known_false_positives: Administrators may allow creation of script or exe in the paths
  specified. Filter as needed.
