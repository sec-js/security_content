description: The following analytic detects a suspicious PowerShell command attempting
  to delete the Windows Defender directory. It leverages PowerShell Script Block Logging
  to identify commands containing "rmdir" and targeting the Windows Defender path.
  This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt to disable or corrupt
  Windows Defender, a key security component. If confirmed malicious, this action
  could allow an attacker to bypass endpoint protection, facilitating further malicious
  activities without detection.
data_source:
- Powershell Script Block Logging 4104
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText = "*rmdir *" AND ScriptBlockText
  = "*\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender*" | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime by Opcode Computer UserID EventCode ScriptBlockText | rename UserID
  as user | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `powershell_remove_windows_defender_directory_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
  https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.
