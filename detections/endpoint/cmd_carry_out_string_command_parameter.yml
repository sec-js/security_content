description: The following analytic detects the use of `cmd.exe /c` to execute commands,
  a technique often employed by adversaries and malware to run batch commands or invoke
  other shells like PowerShell. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions and process metadata.
  Monitoring this activity is crucial as it can indicate script-based attacks or unauthorized
  command execution. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to unauthorized
  code execution, privilege escalation, or persistence within the environment.

- Sysmon EventID 1
- Windows Event Log Security 4688
- CrowdStrike ProcessRollup2
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_cmd` AND Processes.process="*
  /c*" by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process
  Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process Processes.process_id
  Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `cmd_carry_out_string_command_parameter_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may be high based on legitimate scripted code
  in any environment. Filter as needed.
