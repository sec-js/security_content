description: The following analytic detects the use of NetExec (formally CrackmapExec) a toolset used for post-exploitation enumeration and attack within Active Directory environments through command line parameters. It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) data to identify specific command-line arguments associated with actions like ticket manipulation, kerberoasting, and password spraying. This activity is significant as NetExec is used by adversaries to exploit Kerberos for privilege escalation and lateral movement. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access, persistence, and potential compromise of sensitive information within the network.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, legitimate applications may use the same command line parameters as NetExec. Filter as needed.
